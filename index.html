    <p class="bodyPara">If you’re looking for a result-oriented digital marketer then you’ve come to the right place. I’m Jarod Spiewak, a digital marketer who specializes in white-hat SEO (Search Engine Optimization). My passion is to see businesses succeed and that’s exactly what I help them do.  When you work with me you will get high-quality work, excellent communication, detailed reports, and most importantly- results.

My clients leave high praise for my work and you can read some of my <a href="/portfolio.html#testimonials">client testimonials</a>. </p>
    
<h3>Why do I do what I do?
</h3>
<p class="bodyPara">I’ve had a passion for business and technology since I was about 8 years old. In high school I started freelancing. I started off ghost-writing marketing articles for blogs which eventually lead me to write an article about why SEO is important. At the time I knew nothing about SEO so this article took me a lot of research. I was in awe with the analytical, marketing, and technical aspects of SEO. After I wrote that article I started doing more research and taking on SEO based projects for small websites. This has since grown into having a constant work flow of businesses both large and small! At the end of the day I am passionate about what I do and am eager to work with new clients and to create long lasting relationships!</p>
    
<h3>Why should you hire me?
</h3>
<p class="bodyPara">I want to see you succeed, I want to help you succeed. I don’t see my clients as just another job or a dollar sign, I see my clients as friends that I want to help in any way that I can. You’ll get quality, timely, and result-oriented work from me. I make myself available for my clients so that I can answer any questions and deliver comprehensive reports. Have questions for me? Feel free to <a href="/contact.html">contact me</a> and I will get back to you as soon as I can.</p>
