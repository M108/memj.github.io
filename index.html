<h3 class="bodyH3">Why do I do what I do?
</h3>
<p class="bodyPara">I’ve had a passion for business and development since I was about 8 years old, so it’s of no surprise that I have been pursuing both of them ever since. I started freelancing by ghost-writing marketing articles for blogs which eventually lead me to write an article about why SEO is important. At the time I knew nothing about SEO so this article took me a lot of research. I was in awe with the analytical, marketing, and technical aspects of SEO. After I wrote that article I started doing more research and taking on SEO based projects for small websites. As my understanding of SEO grew, I learned the basics to HTML and CSS but this not where my knowledge of development started. <br>
While I was growing up I was always interested in how digital media works. How does clicking this link know to bring me to this website? How does Google know what website(s) will best answer my search queries? How does pressing the “A” button on my Xbox make my character jump at that exact second and how does the game stop me from traveling beyond the map? Until high school, I didn’t have much of an answer besides “code” and even then I barely knew what code was or how it worked. I stumbled upon an online game from Kongregate The Programmer RPG in which the game teaches you the basics of ActionScript 3. This started my journey into development which continued with me learning iOS development using Objective-C and Swift (1.x), which lead me to game development with Unity5 using C# and Javascript. Development kept my interest and I wanted to expand my knowledge of web development, so I joined <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com/memj">FCC</a> and <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/">TOP</a>.
